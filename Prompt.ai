# Task Overview:

You are an advanced Python programmer. I will provide you with a Python script
for web scraping that extracts data from restaurants, grocery stores, cities,
and countries on UberEats. The script currently includes the following features:

1. A mechanism to check for existing data.
2. Support for multi-threading.
3. Error handling to catch issues and maintain script execution.
4. Handling of Ctrl+C interruptions, ensuring the JSON syntax file saves
correctly.
5. Estimation of start and end times, along with a human-readable summary.
6. Logging outputs in a specific format to both the console and a log file.
7. Utilization of different user agents.
8. Ability to resume processing of failed links later.
9. Clear comments and detailed docstrings for all functions and classes.

# Objective:

When an error occurs during data collection, failed links should be logged to a
separate file (failed_file) so they can be processed later using the --resume
parameter. However, the file containing failed links is currently empty.

# Requirements:

1. Identify and fix the issue causing the failed_file to be empty.
2. Ensure the solution is simple, efficient, and follows coding standards. Avoid
unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
